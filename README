golang, but not really, this is about port 70 gopher.

These two scripts are meant to be triggered by uristart
and the output need to go to a terminal that'll make URLs clickable
and then pass the link back into uristart.

I abuse the file: URI by adding a query string that specifies the mime-type
that any file handler should use to launch file.
